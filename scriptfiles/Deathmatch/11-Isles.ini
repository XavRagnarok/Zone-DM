GEN_Info=Isles is a large conquest map with 4 very different landmarks. The first is a huge sinking aircraft carrier, with the top deck above water there are two planes here for air assault, underneath is another floor with ammo crates vehicles and a lot of water in one end, the level below is completely submerged, swimming down would almost be suicide, but there is a nice surprise down there if you do! The second landmark is a small outpost island, it has a bunker on it and a boat jetty, the bunker provides good cover if a plane has spotted you. The third place is two rock stumps sticking out the water, the first is quite high up and the second is lower with a jetty on the back and a shed with an ammo crate in it. There is a small bridge that connects the two stumps together. The final place of interest is a very long airstrip build on a raised bit of sand, at one end is a pile of large rocks, an approach from this end is good as you can hide in the rocks and snipe enemies. Down the airstrip is some broken planes, a bunker with ammo, a refilling station and some vehicles, at the other end is a large broken warehouse which is perfect for an ambush. On the runway are some planes, perfect for an air assault, and because the carrier has planes, this can cause an all out airborne dogfight!
